## Description
This is a progressive web application that allows a user to track their budget on or offline.

## Installation Instructions
npm i (all dependencies are in package.json)

## Usage Information
Name transactions and enter an amount, then click either the add or subtract funds button to log the event to the database. A graphic of your budget will appear below. If you are offline (or select offline mode from the dev tools), the budget will still track your transactions, and will update the database when you are back online.
